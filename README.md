# Nature Finder

Nature Finder is an application that will allow you to search a zipcode to find nearby parks, trails and other natural points of interest.

**User Story:** AS A user, I WANT to locate and view info about natural points-of-interest in my area, SO THAT I can decide which one to visit.

This app utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and multiple APIs to create a single-page application to find nearby parks or trails. The user enters their zip code and is shown the name, address, phone #, and website (if applicable) for up to 5 natural POIs in a 5km radius. The zip code is passed to a function that fetches a positionstack API to return the geographical coordinates and city/state name. A second function then uses the coordinates to fetch the POI data from a Bing Maps API. A 3rd API with Bing Maps was installed as a backup to support the positionstack API, as the free version of positionstack does not support HTTPS encryption, which is required by GitHub Pages. As a result, the positionstack API is only usable in a test environment.
